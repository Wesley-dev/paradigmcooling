<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This privacy notice aims to inform you about how we collect and process any information that we collect from you, or
that you provide to us. It covers information that could identify you (“personal information”) and information that
could not. In the context of the law and this notice, “process” means collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on

<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information. Our policy is not just
an exercise in complying with the law, but a continuation of our respect for you and your personal information.</p>
<p>We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us and hope that you reciprocate.</p>
<p>Our policy complies with the Protection of Personal Information Act 2013.</p>

        <h2>Information we process</h2>
        <p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal information about you. We have collated these into
        groups as follows:</p>
        <p>Your identity includes information such as first name, last name, title, date of birth, and other identifiable
        information that you may have provided at some time.</p>
        <p>Your contact information includes information such as billing address, delivery address, email address, telephone

        information that does not identify you as an individual. Aggregated information may be derived from your personal
        information but is not considered personal information in law because it does not reveal your identity.</p>
        <p>For example, we may aggregate profile information to assess interest in a product or service.</p>

        we treat the combined data as personal information, and it will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Special personal information</h2>
        <p>Special personal information is data about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life,
        political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and biometric data.</p>
        <p>It also includes information about criminal convictions and offences.</p>
        <p>We do not collect any special personal information about you.</p>
        <p>OR</p>
        <p>We may collect special personal information about you if there is a lawful basis on which to do so.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>If you do not provide personal information we need</h2>
        <p>Where we need to collect personal information by law, or under the terms of a contract, we have with you, and you fail
        to provide that information when requested, we may not be able to perform that contract. In that case, we may have to
        stop providing a service to you. If so, we will notify you of this at the time.</p>
        <h2>The bases on which we process information about you</h2>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Information we process because we have a contractual obligation with you</h2>
        <p>When you create an account on our website, buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and
        conditions, a contract is formed between you and us.</p>
        <p>In order to carry out our obligations under that contract, we must process the information you give us. Some of this
        information may be personal information.</p>
        <p>We may use it in order to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>verify your identity for security purposes</li>
            <li>sell products to you</li>
            <li>provide you with our services</li>
            <li>provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain the most from using our website</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We process this information on the basis there is a contract between us, or that you have requested we use the
        information before we enter into a legal contract.</p>
        <p>We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under
        the terms of the contract.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Information we process with your consent</h2>
        <p>Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our
        website or ask us to provide you more information about our business, including job opportunities and our products and
        services, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.</p>
        <p>Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information, for example, by asking you to
        agree to our use of cookies.</p>
        <p>If you have given us explicit permission to do so, we may from time to time, pass your name and contact information to
        selected associates whom we consider may provide services or products you would find useful.</p>
        <p>We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent or it can be reasonably assumed
        that your consent no longer exists.</p>
        <p>You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us at info@paradigmcooling.co.za or www.paradigmcooling.co.za.
        However, if you do so, you may not be able to use our website or our services further.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Information we process for the purposes of legitimate interests</h2>
        <p>We may process the information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so.</p>
        <p>Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having given careful consideration to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>whether the same objective could be achieved through other means</li>
            <li>whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm</li>
            <li>whether you would expect us to process your information, and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable
            to do so</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, we may process your information on this basis for the purposes of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our organizational or business</li>
            <li>responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect a response</li>
            <li>protecting and asserting the legal rights of any party</li>
            <li>insuring against or obtaining professional advice that is required to manage organizational or business risk</li>
            <li>protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to do so</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Information we process because we have a legal obligation</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, we must process your information in order to comply with a statutory obligation.</p>
        <p>For example, we may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper
        authorization such as a search warrant or court order.</p>
        <p>This may include your personal information.</p>
        <h2>Specific uses of information you provide to us</h2>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Information provided on the understanding that it will be shared with a third party</h2>
        <p>Our website allows you to post information with a view to that information being read, copied, downloaded, or used by
        other people.</p>
        <p>Examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>posting a message on our forum</li>

            <li>clicking on an icon next to another visitor’s message to convey your agreement, disagreement or thanks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In posting personal information, it is up to you to satisfy yourself about the privacy level of every person who might
        use it.</p>
        <p>We do not specifically use this information except to allow it to be displayed or shared.</p>
        <p>We do store it, and we reserve a right to use it in the future in any way we decide.</p>
        <p>Once your information enters the public domain, we have no control over what any individual third party may do with it.
        We accept no responsibility for their actions at any time.</p>
        <p>Provided your request is reasonable and there is no legal basis for us to retain it, then at our discretion, we may
        agree to your request to delete personal information that you have posted. You can make a request by contacting us at
        info@paradigmcooling.co.za.</p>

        <p>We do not moderate or control what is posted.</p>

        <p>If we feel it is justified or if we believe the law requires us to do so, we shall remove the content while we
        investigate.</p>
        <p>Free speech is a fundamental right, so we have to make a judgment as to whose right will be obstructed: yours, or that
        of the person who posted the content that offends you.</p>
        <p>If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you about it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Information relating to your method of payment</h2>
        <p>First option:</p>
        <p>We store information about your debit or credit card or other means of payment when you first provide it to us.</p>

            </ul>
            <li>Access to your payment information is restricted to authorized staff only.</li>
            <li>If we ask you questions about your payment information, we only show [partial detail OR the first four OR the last
            four digits of the debit or credit card number], so that you can identify the means of payment to which we refer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We automatically delete your payment information [after X days OR when a credit or debit card expires].</p>
        <p>Second option:</p>
        <p>Payment information is never taken by us or transferred to us either through our website or otherwise. Our employees and
        contractors never have access to it.</p>
        <p>At the point of payment, you are transferred to a secure page on the website of [WorldPay / OPayo / PayPal] or some
        other reputable payment service provider. That page may be branded to look like a page on our website, but it is not
        controlled by us.</p>

        <p>If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact some other person, we may decide to give to that other person some
        of the information contained in your complaint. We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole
        discretion as to whether we do give information, and if we do, what that information is.</p>
        <p>We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide,
